# TutorLink

## Introduction

**TutorLink** is a streamlined, offline application developed for professors at NUS who manage single-staffed classes. It is designed to simplify the management of class assignments, and other administrative tasks, allowing professors to focus on teaching and curriculum development. By automating repetitive tasks and providing quick access to essential information, TutorLink saves valuable time and reduces the burden of administrative work.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest .jar file  of `TutorLink` from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W13-4/tp/releases/tag/v2.1).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TutorLink.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the java -jar TutorLink.jar command to run the application.

Your command terminal should look similar to the one below.

## Important Notes on Commands:
When inputting commands into `TutorLink`, kindly take note of the following:
- Commands with duplicate parameters will be rejected. *i.e* `add_student n/John Doe n/John Doe i/A1234567X`
- Parameters must be separated by at least one space character, otherwise the entire continuous string following a prefix
will be considered a single parameter. *i.e* `add_student i/A1234567X n/John Doei/A1234567X` will be intepreted as adding
a student with the name of `John Doei/A1234567X` and matric number `A1234567X`.
- Parameters must be passed **directly** after the corresponding prefix *i.e* `i/MATRIC_NUMBER`. 
Rouge spaces in between the prefix *i.e* `i/ MATRIC_NUMBER` will invalidate the command and be treated as a `null parameter`.
- Parameters can be supplied in any order. *i.e* `add_student n/John i/A1234567X` is the same as `add_student i/A1234567X n/John`
- **IMPORTANT**: Descriptions should **NOT** contain any separator tokens: `|` as this character is used for storage). 
Including these may yield unpredictable results with the `Storage` component. 
- Matric Number (`i/` argument) is case-sensitive. Therefore, only `A1234567X` is the accepted and not `a1234567x`. Matric numbers 
will be remain in uppercase for storage.
- Similarly, all other fields will be converted to lowercase for storage.

### Saving the data

TutorLink data is saved in the hard disk automatically after every command execution. There is no need to save manually.
Existing data from previous application runs are loaded on startup.

The data from the student, component and grade lists are stored in `studentlist.txt`, `componentlist.txt` and `gradelist.txt`
respectively, located in the `[JAR file location]/data/` directory.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: To transfer data, simply copy the `TutorLink` home folder (where the `.jar` file and data files are located) to your new computer. Then, download Java 17 (if not already installed), place the `.jar` file in the copied folder, and run `java -jar TutorLink.jar` from that folder.

**Q**: Can I update data by directly editing the data files?

**A**: Do so at your own risk. If changes to the data file alter its format, invalid file lines will discarded 
during startup, and displayed in the command line for verification. While TutorLink can detect most invalid file entries, 
certain edits can cause unexpected behaviour. Therefore, it is not recommended to edit the data files
unless you are confident you can do so correctly.
