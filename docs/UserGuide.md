### Saving the data

TutorLink data is saved in the hard disk automatically after every command execution. There is no need to save manually.
Existing data from previous application runs are loaded on startup.

The data from the student, component and grade lists are stored in `studentlist.txt`, `componentlist.txt` and `gradelist.txt`
respectively, located in the `[JAR file location]/data/` directory.

---
## Notes:
- Matric Number (`i/` argument) is case insensitive. Therefore, `A1234567X` is the same as `a1234567x`. Matric numbers 
will be converted to uppercase for storage. 
- (coming soon) All other arguments are case insensitive and will be converted to lowercase for storage. 
## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: To transfer data, simply copy the `TutorLink` home folder (where the `.jar` file and data files are located) to your new computer. Then, download Java 17 (if not already installed), place the `.jar` file in the copied folder, and run `java -jar TutorLink.jar` from that folder.

**Q**: Can I update data by directly editing the data files?

**A**: Do so at your own risk. If changes to the data file alter its format, invalid file lines will discarded 
during startup, and displayed in the command line for verification. While TutorLink can detect most invalid file entries, 
certain edits can cause unexpected behaviour. Therefore, it is not recommended to edit the data files
unless you are confident you can do so correctly.
