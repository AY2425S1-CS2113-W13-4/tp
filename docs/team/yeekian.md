## Project: TutorLink
TutorLink is a desktop CLI application designed to help
University professors better manage the grades of students
reading their course.

TutorLink keeps a running tally of grades (GPA, overall score) of each
`Student` by tagging `Components` to each student via a `Grade` object.

TutorLink provides useful summary statistics of a professor's course that
can be further filtered down for analysis.

### Summary of Contributions

- New Feature: Added a parser to decipher commands and command arguments from user input strings
    - What it does: After being given the user input string, the parser identify the command that the user is trying to execute and returns the command object. The parser will also be able to extract the input arguments for the command from the rest of the string and store them in a HashMap
    - Justification: This feature allows the sense-making of user input data. It provides a bridge between the user and the other features of the app.


- New Feature: Added the command to add and delete grade to components for individual students
    - What it does: Allows the user to add grades for individuals for individual graded assessment components one at a time. The added grades can also be individually deleted for a specific student and his/her component via the delete grade command.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user needs to be able to record and remove scores of assessment components, such as assignments, for students. This way, the user will be able to keep a record of these grades and use them to calculate their final grade. 
    - Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it required adherence to the data case when searching for duplicate or existing grades. This was accomplished by standardising the finding functions to check in uppercase.
    - Credits: While the processing of input user arguments and the handling of errors are done on my own, the method to add a Grade object into the list of grades, GradeList, was created by @TrungBui32.


- New Feature: Added the command to add new components
    - What it does: allows the user to add new assessment components.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    - Highlights: The command checks for duplicates and prevents additional components from being added.
