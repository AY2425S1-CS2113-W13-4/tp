## Design & implementation

### Architecture

The high-level design of TutorLink is as depicted in the following **Architecture Diagram**:

![Architecture.png](diagrams/Architecture.png)

**Main Components of the Architecture**

<code>TutorLink</code>: Main class that serves as the main entry point of the application.

- At app launch, TutorLink initializes components (<code>Parser</code>, <code>Ui</code>, <code>Storage</code>, <code>
  AppState</code>).
- On app shutdown, it shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods.

The key classes providing functionality to TutorLink are:

1. <code>AppState</code>: Stores global variables/resources required by TutorLink at run time.
2. <code>Ui</code>: Collects data (via Strings sent via CLI) from the user and relays information to the user (via
   printing back to the CLI).
3. <code>Parser</code>: Interprets the raw data from the user; applies data validation and handles necessary exceptions.
4. <code>Storage</code>: Handles the loading and storage of data to be retained even after TutorLink is shut down.
5. <code>CommandResult</code>: Represents the result of user input.

### Target User Profile

The target users for **TutorLink** are professors at NUS who manage small, single-staffed classes. These professors
typically have strong technical expertise but are often overwhelmed by time-consuming administrative tasks that detract
from their ability to focus on teaching and curriculum development.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Time-Constrained**: Professors have limited time for lesson preparation due to the administrative burden of managing
  grades, assignments, and attendance.
- **Technologically Savvy**: While proficient in using educational platforms, they often find existing tools slow,
  overly complex, or requiring constant internet connectivity.
- **Desire for Simplicity**: They prefer tools that are easy to use, automate repetitive tasks, and function offline,
  allowing them to streamline administrative work without unnecessary complexity.

The target user values efficiency, reliability, and simplicity, seeking a solution that reduces administrative workload
and enables them to focus more on the core aspects of teaching.

### Value Proposition

**TutorLink** solves the problem of administrative overload by automating routine tasks such as managing assignments,
and monitoring student performance. Professors often struggle with time-consuming admin work that takes away from their
primary focus: teaching and preparing lessons.

By offering an offline, lightweight solution that simplifies these processes, TutorLink helps professors:

- Save time by automating tedious administrative tasks.
- Access important information quickly, without needing an internet connection.
- Focus on teaching and lesson development instead of being bogged down by admin work.

In contrast to bloated systems, TutorLink is designed to be fast, simple, and effectiveâ€”freeing up valuable time and
enhancing teaching efficiency.

## User Stories

| Version | As a ... | I want to ...             | So that I can ...                                           |
|---------|----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| v1.0    | new user | see usage instructions    | refer to them when I forget how to use the application      |
| v2.0    | user     | find a to-do item by name | locate a to-do without having to go through the entire list |

## Non-Functional Requirements

{Give non-functional requirements}

1. Performance: The system should respond to any command within a few seconds
2. Reliability: The system should not lose any user data even if it crashes unexpectedly
3. Usability: A new user should be able to use basic features without confusion
4. Compatibility: The system should work on any mainstream OS (Windows, macOS, Linux) that has Java 11 or above
   installed
5. Maintainability: The system should be able to export all data in a human-readable format for backup purposes

## Implementation

### Command execution sequence: 

All commands follow the sequence as described in the diagram below: 

![ArchitectureSequenceGrouped.png](diagrams%2FArchitectureSequenceGrouped.png)

Where <code>ref</code> frame is a placeholder for each command's specific operations.

The specific implementation of noteworthy operations are presented below: 

### Add/Delete Student/Component Feature

Feature implemented by `AddStudentCommand`, `DeleteStudentCommand`, `AddComponentCommand` and `DeleteComponentCommand` 
for `Student` and `Component` respectively. 

The flow of logic for both `Student` and `Component` commands can be summarized as follows: 

1. Retrieve arguments from `HashMap`.
2. Execute data validation on the arguments and throw appropriate exception in the case of failure.
3. Add/Delete `Student` and `Component`.
4. Return `CommandResult` that contains the result of the Add/Delete operation.

The following sequence diagrams depict the exact steps involved in the `AddStudentCommand`:

![AddStudentCommand.png](diagrams/AddStudentCommand.png)

The logic for `AddComponentCommand` is very similar and thus is not depicted. 

Likewise, the sequence diagram for `DeleteStudentCommand` is as follows: 

![DeleteStudentCommand.png](diagrams%2FDeleteStudentCommand.png)

Since a `Grade` object is only well-defined when there are both `Student` and `Component` objects to be refrenced by `Grade`,
whenever a `Student` or `Component` object is deleted, the corresponding `Grade` object is queried and then deleted as well. 

### Add/Delete Grade Feature

#### Implementation Details

The `AddGradeCommand` and `DeleteGradeCommand` classes handle the addition and deletion of grades for students within the TutorLink application. Each command validates user input to ensure accuracy and consistency before making changes, preserving data integrity. Grades are stored as `Grade` objects within a `GradeList`.

#### Key Operations

- **`AddGradeCommand.execute(AppState appState, HashMap<String, String> arguments)`**: Adds a grade to a student by performing the following steps:
  1. Retrieves and validates the matriculation number, component description, and score from `arguments`.
  2. Checks that the specified component and student exist.
  3. Ensures the score is within the allowable range for the specified component.
  4. Creates a new `Grade` object and adds it to the `GradeList` in `AppState`.

The sequence diagram of the AddGradeCommand is shown below.

![AddGradeCommand.png](diagrams%2FAddGradeCommand.png)

- **`DeleteGradeCommand.execute(AppState appState, HashMap<String, String> arguments)`**: Removes a grade from a student by performing these steps:
  1. Retrieves and validates the matriculation number and component description from `arguments`.
  2. Confirms the existence of the specified component and student.
  3. Locates and deletes the `Grade` object from the `GradeList` in `AppState`.

    
The sequence diagram of the DeleteGradeCommand is shown below.

![DeleteGradeCommand.png](diagrams%2FDeleteGradeCommand.png)

### Storage Load feature

The `StudentStorage`, `GradeStorage` and `ComponentStorage` classes implement the feature to load data from the 
data `.txt` files into their respective List objects at the start of the program.

The load list methods for the Storage classes have largely similar logic flows.  
The following section and sequence diagram elaborate on the implementation of the `loadGradeList` method in `GradeStorage`:

![GradeStorage.png](diagrams/GradeStorage.png)

1. TutorLink constructs a new `GradeStorage`.
2. TutorLink calls `loadGradeList`.
3. `GradeStorage` creates a new `ArrayList` of `Grade`s.
4. `GradeStorage` creates a new `Scanner` with the path to the file.
5. While there are next lines in the data file:
   - `Scanner` returns the current file line as a String and moves to the next file line.
   - `GradeStorage` calls its `getGradeFromFileLine` method with the file line.
   - If the file line references a valid `Component` and a valid `Student`, a `Grade` is returned and added to the `ArrayList`.
   - If not (e.g. if data file was corrupted), the file line is simply ignored, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
6. The `ArrayList` of `Grade`s is returned to TutorLink.
